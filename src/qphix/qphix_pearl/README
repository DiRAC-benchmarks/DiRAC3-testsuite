Section 1: RELEASE NOTES: 
=========================
These builds were tested (and the compiler flags are set up for) using 
Intel Parallel Studio Cluster Edition: Package ID: l_psf_p_2015.0.2.031
The Intel C/C++ Compiler version was;  (ICC) 15.0.2 20150121

The Xeon Phi Nodes used for testing displayed the following 
Version Info:

 	Flash Version 		 : 2.1.02.0390
	SMC Firmware Version	 : 1.16.5078
	SMC Boot Loader Version	 : 1.8.4326
	uOS Version 		 : 2.6.38.8+mpss3.1.2

The model information was:

 	Board SKU 		 : B1PRQ-5110P
	ECC Mode 		 : Enabled
	SMC HW Revision 	 : Product 225W Passive CS

The Xeon Phi was booted with Extra Command line arguments:

	ExtraCommandLine "highres=off clocksource=tsc cgroup_disable=memory icache_snoop_off"

The host CPU identified in /proc/cpuinfo as:

	model name	: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 0 @ 2.00GHz
	cpu MHz		: 2000.212
	cache size	: 20480 KB

The Host Was Running CentOS with Kernel revision:  2.6.32-220.7.1.el6.x86_64

The build scripts and run scripts utilize the BASH shell for scripting, in a Linux environment.
Scripts to launch runs on Xeon Phi co-processors from the host utilize Intel MPI and mpiexec.hydra
The examples have not been tested on Windows Systems, or MacOS X systems.

Your mileage may vary, and we explcitly disclaim responsibility for any effects (good or bad) arising 
from use of this package.


Section 2: Contents of the package:
===================================

README -- this README File
LICENSES -- Licenses reproduced for dependency libraries and QPhiX

env/   -- scripts to set up compilers and compiler options

Dependencies/ -- QDP++ and LibXML2 dependencies

Original/ -- The original (cpp_wilson_dslash) with Xeon Phi and Xeon builds

qphix-codegen/ -- The code-generator

VectorPrefL1L2BarrierS8/ -- The final optimized version of QPhiX with all
                            generated optimizations and SOA legnth of 8

FinalAVX/ -- The final optimized version of QPhiX, with AVX build


There are also a bunch of directories for QPhiX with a variety of optimizations in the generated code.

Scalar/ -- QPhix with scalar instructions, no prefetching, no barriers etc, with Xeon Phi build
Vector/  -- QPhiX with vector instructions, no prefetching, no barriers etc with Xeon Phi build

VectorPrefL1/ -- Like Vector/ plus L1 prefetching, Xeon Phi build
VectorPrefL2/ -- Like Vector/ plus L2 prefetching, Xeon Phi build
VectorPrefL1L2/ -- Like Vector pluse both L1 and L2 prefetching, 

VectorPrefL1L2Barrier/ -- LikeVectorPrefL1L2 with barriers every 16 T-slices
VectorPrefL1L2BarrierS8/ -- LikeVectorPrefL1L2Barrier with SOA=8 (Final version -- mentioned already)


Section 3: Building and Running the examples
=============================================

To build and run the codes the following is required:
a) in the env/ Directory, set up your compiler paths etc. See Sec. 3
b) build the Dependency libraries in the Dependencies/ direcotry. See Sec 4
c) follow the build and run instructions in the README file of the relevant subdirectory (e.g. Original/README)

As a note all the directories use similar structures to build and run the
codes so once you've got through the dependencies and one example the rest
ought to be straightforward

Section 4: Setting up your environment
======================================

 The env/ subdirectory contains BASH scripts for setting up the compile environment.These scripts may need to be edited to set up your compiler options.

Typically one needs to edit only the first line of the env.sh scripts, to point to the right location to find the Intel compilervars.sh file.

There are 3 scripts in env/

env_mic.sh  -- Set up for Xeon Phi, disabling gather-scatter hints
env_mic_comp_pref.sh -- Set up for Xeon phi, not disabling gather scatter hints
env_avx.sh  -- Set up for Xeon builds with AVX.


Section 5: Building the Dependencies
====================================

The Dependencies/ direcoty  contains the QDP++ framework and the 
libxml2 XML library, on which the correctness tests in QPhiX and the 
correctness and timing routines of  cpp_wilson_dslash depend. 
This file contains scripts to run the "configure; make; make install" 
chain to build QDP++ and LibXML. The scripts in this directory are:

build_all.sh -- Build all dependencies for both Xeon and Xeon Phi
clean.sh -- Clean out previous builds
build_libxml2.sh -- Build LibXML2 for Xeon
build_libxml2_mic.sh -- Build LibXML2 for Xeon Phi
build_qdp++.sh -- Build QDP++ for Xeon 
build_qdp++_mic.sh -- Build QDP++ for Xeon Phi

If the env.sh files in the ../env directory have been set up correctly all that one should need in this directory is to run ./build_all.sh

Section 6: Licensing and Copying
================================
Permission and License is given to distribute this code package, its associated README files build and test scripts
under the Jefferson Lab BSD like license (Jefferson Science Associates LLC below). Software  packages included in this 
distribution (QPhiX, QPhiX-codegen, cpp_wilson_dslash, QDP++) are covered by this license. Subpackages of QDP++ are covered
in part by this license. 

Section 7: Running
================================
cd to each of the directories "Original, Vector*, FinalAVX"
sh build_mic.sh
#edit run_test_mic.sh to conform to your MPI enviornment
sh run_test_mic.sh
