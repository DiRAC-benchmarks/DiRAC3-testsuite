This Directory contains the QPhiX Library with Vectorized kernels, 
but not yet any prefetch optimizations

Building the example code
========================

First Ensure Dependencies are built
then:

i) Build for Xeon Phi, by running ./build_mic.sh
ii) Run the timing on Xeon Phi by 
     1) Modifying ./run_test_mic.sh to suit your environment
     2) Launching the run with ./run_test_mic.sh

Notes:
======
*)  The build_mic.sh scripts simply run configure; make; make check to generate the tests

*) The build takes place in the ./build_mic subdirectory.
   Executables are plased in the ./build_mic/tests/

*) Due to all the template possibilities and multiple #includes, compile times may be *long* -- several minutes.

*) The timing routine is called time_dlash_noqdp and takes
the following command line arguments:

-x <Lx>   -- Lx is the X-dimension of the lattice
-y <Ly>   -- Ly is the Y-dimension of the lattice
-z <Lz>   -- Lz is the Z-dimension of the lattice
-t <Lt>   -- Lt is the T-dimension of the lattice

-pxy <Pxy> -- Pxy is the padding factor in the XY plane
-pxyz <Pxy> -- Pxyz is the padding factor in XYZ volumes

-by <By> -- By is the Y block length
-bz <Bz> -- Bz is the Z block length

-c <Ncores> -- is the number of cores
-sy <Sy>    -- Y dimension of the SMT thread "shape"
-sz <Sz>    -- Z dimension of the SMT thread "shape"

-minct <MinCt> -- the minimum number of splits in T
-compress12    -- add this flag to use compression
-prec <p>      -- Precision p can be h, f, d for Half, float and double

-i <iterss>    -- number of iterations to execute

*) There is also a test routine t_dslash that takes similar arguments, but it is a good idea to omit the -i option when running that.
