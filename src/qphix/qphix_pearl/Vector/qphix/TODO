TO Do:
- Add cache blocking in X -- hooks are already present in the kernels, but need to adapt loops.
- Add other solvers specially multi-shift
- Solve N-systems at once (ongoing PhD project at Old Dominion University Computer Science Department: ODU-JLab collaboration)
- Clean code for non ICC compilers (work ongoing by Diptorup Deb, Renaissance Computing Institute, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
- Add other processor targets: SSE, AVX2, AVX512 - codegen supports these already but need to be added
- Add other fermions: e.g. Twisted Mass, HiSQ, Domain Wall?
- Bullet proof a little (A LOT!!!)
- Better tuning (implement 1/2/3/4 threads per core instead of just all 4)
- reduce verbosite and use master printf to better effect (log levels?)
- more fine grained testing and automatic testing
- ... Your desiderata here...
